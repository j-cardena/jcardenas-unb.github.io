- title: Postdoctoral Research Professional – Dynamic Thermal Rating & DER Analytics
  type: Postdoctoral Fellow
  project: Real-Time DTR & DER-Analytics Platform for NB Power
  start_date: January 5, 2026
  deadline: Open until filled; review begins February 2026
  funding: ResearchNB Research Professional Fund
  open: true
  
  description: |
    The Emera & NB Power Research Center for Smart Grid Technologies at UNB invites applications for a Postdoctoral Research Professional to lead the development, testing, and operationalization of a Dynamic Thermal Rating (DTR) and DER-analytics platform in partnership with NB Power.
    <br><br>
    This position is funded by ResearchNB's Research Professional Fund and offers a unique opportunity to advance technology from TRL 5 to TRL 7 while working directly with utility engineers and operational systems.
    <br><br>
    <strong>Project Overview</strong><br>
    New Brunswick's energy strategy calls for a five-fold increase in wind and solar capacity by 2035. This project addresses a critical barrier: the stress on aging transmission infrastructure from rapid DER growth. Dynamic Thermal Rating can unlock 15–30% additional capacity on existing lines when weather conditions permit, reducing renewable curtailment and deferring costly grid rebuilds. You will convert an existing academic prototype into a robust, production-ready solution integrated with NB Power's operational systems.
    <br><br>
    <strong>Key Responsibilities</strong><br>
    <em>Research & Development (60%)</em>
    <ul>
    <li>Enhance conductor-temperature models by integrating finite-element thermal physics with LSTM-based weather nowcasting</li>
    <li>Implement continuous verification against reference sensors with automated fallbacks</li>
    <li>Target temperature prediction MAE ≤7°C</li>
    <li>Refactor prototype code into modular micro-services</li>
    <li>Implement full CI/CD pipeline on UNB GitLab</li>
    <li>Deploy containerized services on NB Power's on-premises Kubernetes cluster</li>
    <li>Ensure system uptime ≥95% during pilot operations</li>
    <li>Configure secure MQTT data feeds from field sensors</li>
    <li>Conduct 3-month live trials on two transmission corridors</li>
    <li>Develop explainability dashboards and operator alarms</li>
    </ul>
    <em>Knowledge Transfer & Mentorship (40%)</em>
    <ul>
    <li>Co-supervise 2 MSc and 2 BEng capstone students</li>
    <li>Lead workshops for NB Power engineers and provincial DER developers</li>
    <li>Publish code under Apache 2.0 open-source license</li>
    <li>Contribute to NB Energy Futures white-paper</li>
    </ul>
